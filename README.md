# DCS F/A-18C Hornet Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS Binds

These are my binds for the DCS F/A-18C module.

## Installation
Put the files you want into:
```
Saved Games\DCS.OpenBeta\Config\Input\FA-18C_hornet
```

You will then have to rename the files, so that they have the correct filenaming for your system; 
```
Joystick - HOTAS Warthog {34B5CE30-4407-11e8-8001-444553540000}.diff.lua  ==> Joystick - HOTAS Warthog {YOUR-HARDAWRE-ID-HERE}.diff.lua
```
